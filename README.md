**SELF START GENSET**

The "Self-Start Genset" project is like a super-smart generator. It uses fancy technology (ESP32) and a cool cloud system (ThingWorx) so you can turn it on and monitor it from anywhere in the world with just one virtual button press. The project uses a bunch of clever parts that work together, like relays and servo motors, making the generator run all by itself. It's not just about being high-tech; it lets you understand and control the generator in a whole new way, thanks to real-time updates and data logging. This project is changing how we think about making power efficiently and easily.
